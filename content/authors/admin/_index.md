I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), where I study the psychological effects of digital technologies. An increasing proportion of the human experience is now mediated by digital technology and taking place online. I want to know what are the impacts of the increased use of those technologies on our cognition, well-being, and social interactions.
